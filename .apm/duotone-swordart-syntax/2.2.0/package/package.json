It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.\n\n![CSS example](http://i.imgur.com/AyHPVWE.png)\n\n\n## Language support\n\nDuoTone themes are optimized for many languages:\n\n> C, Clojure, CoffeeScript, C#, CSS, GF Markdown, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Less, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, SASS, SCSS, Stylus, XML, YAML...\n\nMore optimizations to come. See the growing list of [all](/styles/languages).\n\n\n## Variations\n\nHere a list for all [DuoTone themes](https://atom.io/themes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=keyword:duotone). Or at least the ones that have the `duotone` keyword added. :grin:\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/demhydraz/duotone-swordart-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/demhydraz/duotone-swordart-syntax#readme","_id":"duotone-swordart-syntax@2.2.0","_shasum":"0815cfb44a825be7d23d283d8815b8c5ab0ea88c","_resolved":"file:../d-116119-2261-y48zew/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116119-2261-y48zew/package.tgz"}
